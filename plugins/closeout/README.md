# closeout — a documentation safety net for Claude Code

I have found that promoting documentation into durable memory for purposes of session continuity as well as team sharing is one of the more valuable, but difficult to enforce, information management disciplines in co-working with agentic AI. This plugin helps with that.

It is **not** a replacement for updating docs during real work. It is the net under the sessions where the closeout was missed.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add cyberscribe/closeout-plugin
/plugin install closeout@closeout-marketplace
```

Or from a local checkout:

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/closeout-plugin
/plugin install closeout@closeout-marketplace
```

To pin it for a whole team instead, commit this to the repository's
`.claude/settings.json` — teammates get the source without running anything:

```jsonc
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "closeout-marketplace": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "cyberscribe/closeout-plugin" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "closeout@closeout-marketplace": true }
}
```

Vendoring it as a git submodule works too — point the source at the checkout
directory rather than GitHub:

```jsonc
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "closeout-marketplace": {
      "source": { "source": "directory", "path": ".claude/plugins/closeout" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "closeout@closeout-marketplace": true }
}
```

That pins the exact commit in your repo's history and needs no network at
install time, at the cost of a `git submodule update --init` on clone.

Claude Code gates hooks behind a trust prompt. **Approve them once when asked** —
if you don't, the hooks silently never run and you get `/closeout` only.

## How it works

| Part | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `/closeout` command | A saved prompt. Type it before ending a session and the agent reviews learnings and updates durable docs **live, with full context** — the highest-quality path. |
| Capture hook (`SessionEnd`) | Spawns a **detached, sandboxed** headless `claude -p` that reads the just-ended transcript and writes candidate notes to a draft file outside the repo. The automatic backstop. |
| Review hook (`SessionStart`) | If drafts exist, injects a reminder instructing the agent to surface them first-thing and offer to promote — confirm the proposed tier, verify each claim against current code, then promote and delete the draft, only with your go-ahead. Never silently. |

```
session ends ──▶ SessionEnd ──▶ closeout-capture.sh
                                  └─▶ detached `claude -p` reads transcript,
                                      writes draft (only if something durable)
                                         │
next session starts ──▶ SessionStart ──▶ closeout-review.sh
                                  └─▶ injects "pending draft" reminder
                                         │
                         agent promotes durable items into docs, deletes draft
```

Drafts live at `~/.claude/closeout-drafts/<project-basename>/<session-id>.md` —
deliberately outside the git repo: never committed by accident, per-user, and
persistent across reboots.

## Default taxonomy

The default taxonomy aligns with [Robert Peake](https://www.robertpeake.com/ai)'s research and observations about optimising AI co-cognition at organisational scale:

![Figure 1 - distributed knowledge management for agentic AI at organisational scale](https://www.robertpeake.com/files/2026/08/exec-fn-ai-org_2026-08-26-scaled.png "Figure 1 - distributed knowledge management for agentic AI at organisational scale")

## Required project setup

Two things the plugin cannot do for you, because a plugin cannot edit your
settings. Add them to the consuming project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      // Lets the agent delete a draft after promoting it, without a prompt.
      // `rm` everywhere else still prompts.
      "Bash(rm *closeout-drafts*)"
    ]
  },
  "sandbox": {
    "filesystem": {
      // Only needed if you run with the sandbox enabled. The draft directory is
      // outside the default writable set, so without this the in-session agent
      // can read a draft but never delete it.
      "allowWrite": ["~/.claude/closeout-drafts"]
    }
  }
}
```

A copy-paste version is in [`examples/settings.snippet.json`](examples/settings.snippet.json).

A `sandbox.allowWrite` change only takes effect in a **newly started** session,
not the one in which you edited it.

## Configuring it

Zero configuration required. The plugin auto-detects your documentation directory
(`docs/` → `doc/` → `documentation/` → repo root) and the conventional locations
for the other tiers.

### The promotion taxonomy

A captured learning is classified on two axes before anything is promoted:

**Tier**, which decides how often it is loaded back into context:

| Tier | Loaded back | Shared destination (detected) | Individual destination |
|---|---|---|---|
| Working standards | ALWAYS — every session, every turn | `CLAUDE.md` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| General reference | as needed, in ANY project | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Project reference | as needed, only in THIS project | `docs/`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` | `~/.claude/projects/<p>/memory/` |
| Templates & agent roles | as needed, when invoked | `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/` | `~/.claude/agents/` |

**Scope**: shared (committed, reaches teammates) or individual (this machine only).

The agent is told to default to the cheapest tier that works, and that the
always-loaded tier is a budget rather than a folder — promotion into it is
zero-sum, and must name what it displaces or justify the budget growing. Every
other tier is additive. That rule is the point of the taxonomy: without it an
always-on file grows monotonically and every future session pays for it.

### Overriding it

Two levels, depending on how much you want to change.

**Moving destinations** — keep the four tiers, point them at your files. Set these
under `"env"` in the project's `.claude/settings.json`:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `CLOSEOUT_TIER_ALWAYS` | first of `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `CLOSEOUT_TIER_GENERAL` | first of `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/plugins/` |
| `CLOSEOUT_TIER_PROJECT` | `<doc dir>/`, `<doc dir>/DECISIONS.md` |
| `CLOSEOUT_TIER_TEMPLATES` | first of `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/` |

**Replacing the taxonomy** — different tiers, names, count, or load rates. Put a
`## Promotion tiers` heading in `.claude/closeout.md`. The plugin detects that
heading, suppresses its own table entirely so the prompts never carry two
competing tier lists, and treats your section as the only taxonomy. The
`CLOSEOUT_TIER_*` variables are then ignored.

`.claude/closeout.md` is read verbatim by both the command and the capture hook,
and overrides everything — tier names, destinations, load rates, and any house
rules you add. It is prose appended to a prompt; there is no schema to learn. See
[`examples/project-conventions.md`](examples/project-conventions.md) for both
forms worked through.

### Other environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOSEOUT_DISABLED` | unset | `1` disables both hooks, leaving `/closeout` alone. |
| `CLOSEOUT_MODEL` | `sonnet` | Model for the capture child. `haiku` is cheaper. |
| `CLOSEOUT_DOC_DIR` | auto-detected | Documentation directory, repo-relative. |
| `CLOSEOUT_DECISIONS_FILE` | `<doc dir>/DECISIONS.md` | Where architectural decisions are logged. |
| `CLOSEOUT_MIN_LINES` | `6` | Transcript lines below which a session is too trivial to capture. |
| `CLOSEOUT_DRAFT_ROOT` | `~/.claude/closeout-drafts` | Where drafts are kept. |
| `CLOSEOUT_DRAFT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `3` | Age at which an unpromoted draft is pruned. |
| `CLOSEOUT_CLAUDE_BIN` | auto-detected | Explicit path to the `claude` binary. |

## Dependencies

Resolved against a minimal hook environment, not your shell:

- **`jq`** — required. Ships with macOS; `apt install jq` / `brew install jq` elsewhere.
- **`claude`** — the capture script probes `command -v`, then `~/.local/bin/claude`,
  then `/usr/local/bin/claude`. Set `CLOSEOUT_CLAUDE_BIN` if yours is elsewhere.
- **`nohup`** — required (system).
- **`setsid`** — *optional*. Used for a clean detach when present; **not on stock
  macOS**. Falls back to `nohup … & disown`, which works without it.

## Cost

Each non-trivial session close spawns one headless run billed to your account.
`sonnet` by default; set `CLOSEOUT_MODEL=haiku` to reduce it, or
`CLOSEOUT_DISABLED=1` to keep only the manual `/closeout`.

## Security posture

The capture child is deliberately boxed in:

- `--allowedTools "Read,Write"` — no Bash, no network tools.
- `--add-dir` limited to exactly the transcript's directory (read) and the draft
  directory (write). It cannot touch your repo, your settings, or other projects.
- It is told explicitly not to edit any in-repo documentation — only the scratch file.

Promotion into real docs always happens in a normal, interactive session with
your approval.

## Known limitations & gotchas

- **Reopen race (benign).** Close and *immediately* reopen and the new session's
  `SessionStart` can run before the detached child has finished writing (it makes
  an API call, ~20–40s). The draft is caught on the *following* session, not lost.
- **Trivial sessions are skipped.** `/clear` exits and very short transcripts are
  ignored, and the child is told to write nothing if no durable learning occurred.
  An empty drafts directory therefore means either "hook didn't fire" or "fired
  and correctly found nothing" — see [Troubleshooting](docs/DESIGN.md#troubleshooting)
  to tell them apart.
- **Recursion guard.** The capture child would itself trigger `SessionEnd` on exit;
  the script early-exits when `CLOSEOUT_HOOK_CHILD` is set. Do not remove that guard.
- **Project keying is by directory basename.** Two checkouts with the same
  basename share a draft directory. Set `CLOSEOUT_DRAFT_ROOT` per checkout if that
  bites you.
- **Drafts can be stale or wrong.** They are written by an automated pass over a
  transcript. The review prompt insists on verifying each claim against current
  code before promotion — a bug the draft describes may already be fixed.

## Why a detached child, and not the agent itself

`SessionEnd` (and `PreCompact`) hooks fire *after* the agent loop has exited, and
their stdout is **not** injected into the conversation — so the just-ended agent
cannot be made to do the capture. Only `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
can inject text an active agent sees (that is how the review hook works). Hence
capture must spawn its own headless run.
